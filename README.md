# Introduction
Hacking? What is it? And why learn it.

Hacking for me is a way of thinking. A way of solving problems using existing tools in some fluent and unorthodox way using existing rules.

My goal is to be fluent at various technologies. This repo contains all the code and notes from the book: **Hacking- The Art of Exploitation by Jon Erickson**. 

I've organised my stuff this way so that I can keep track of stuff that I have done. Actual projects that may come up later will be uploaded in a different way in other repos.

I'll also be blogging about some of the things in my [blog](www.saitamasensei.angstrom.co.ke)

I'll be adding lists for various things that need to be completed.
